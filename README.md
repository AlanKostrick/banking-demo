# Banking Demo 
This application will manage a collection of bank accounts. It will be build using Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principles as well as Test Driven Development (TDD)

## Tools utilized
- Java
- Eclipse
- JUnit 
- Hamcrest
- Gradle

This application covers OOP concepts in the form of a banking app demonstration. In your command line, once cloned, use `git branch -a` to view a list of available branches for the app. Use `git checkout branch-name` to switch between branches and dive into the code. You can also use the drop down here on the GUI to view the code history on each branch. To create your own sandbox off of the respective branch you are checked out on do `git checkout -b sandbox-branch-name`. Have fun!
